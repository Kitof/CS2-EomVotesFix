# Display Workshop Map Names and Thumbnails During End-of-Match Vote

![Alt text](img/VoteWithThumbnails.png?raw=true "Vote With Thumbnails")

I tried to understand why **CS2 does not display workshop map thumbnails during end-of-match voting** when the dedicated server is launched with a map collection (`+host_workshop_collection`).

[I already did the job for CSGO](https://github.com/Kitof/csgo_workshop_vote_fix/), but things are more complex for CS2.

> The fix is complex, requires multiple steps, and affects clients more than the server.

To make deployment **easy during a LAN event I organized**, the script is written in **PowerShell**, and *it will generate the script to share with the players* (inside `build/client/*`. Just copy all files and launch install.bat or uninstall.bat to rollback).

Any PC under windows do the job. You don't need to generate the script from the server, but the `gamemodes_server.txt` file to copy to the server is also generated.

## Requirements to generate the client script

- Install the [CS2 Workshop Tools] (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike_2_Workshop_Tools/Installing_and_Launching_Tools)

- Know your **Workshop Collection ID**  
  Example: `https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=*3082703162*`

- Decide whether you want to **also include official maps** in the vote list

## What the script actually does

- Retrieves the list of maps from the collection
- Tries to identify the internal map name (not exposed in CS2‚Äôs API ‚Äî usually requires downloading the map; caching avoids doing this every time)
- Deduces:
  - the internal map name (e.g. `de_bank`)
  - a friendly name (e.g. `Bank`)
- Retrieves the thumbnail via the Steam API
- Converts the `.png` to `.vtex_c` (CS2-compatible format for thumbnails)
- Edits `gamemodes.txt` to include the map list
- Updates all language files to include the friendly names
- Packages everything into a `.vpk`
- Generates `gamemodes_server.txt` for the server
- Generates the **client script** to:
  - copy the `.vpk` into `game/csgo`
  - modify `gameinfo.gi` to include the `.vpk`
